## ðŸ‘‹ Welcome!

This is an **unofficial** GitHub organization run by students and alumni from the **EMINES - School of Industrial Management (UM6P), Morocco**.

We're passionate about Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and the power of Open Source. This space serves as a hub for sharing projects, code, curated resource lists, and other materials developed by our community.

## Our Goals

*   **Democratize Open Source:** Encourage the sharing and contribution to open-source projects within the EMINES community.
*   **Showcase Student Work:** Provide a platform for EMINES students and alumni to share their AI/ML projects and research outputs.
*   **Centralize Resources:** Complement our [Hugging Face Organization](https://huggingface.co/UM6P-EMINES) by hosting resources best suited for GitHub, such as curated "Awesome" lists, code snippets, project templates, and documentation.
*   **Foster Collaboration:** Create a space for collaboration on AI projects, particularly those relevant to the Moroccan context (like Darija NLP).

## What You'll Find Here

*   **Curated Resource Lists:** Collections of useful links, papers, datasets, and models for specific domains.
*   **Project Code:** Source code for various ML/AI projects developed by members.
*   **(Future) Templates & Guides:** Reusable templates or guides for common ML tasks.
